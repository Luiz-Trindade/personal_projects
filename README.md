Hello, my name is Luiz Gabriel Magalh√£es Trindade, and I'm a computer science student. 
As I write this README, I'm currently in the 2nd semester of my course. 

I've created a small programming language and decided to name it 'simple_lang'.
My goal is not to replace the use of any existing language but to 
create it simply for my enjoyment and to pass the time.

Why Python? Because it's straightforward to write anything when you're a bit in a hurry, 
and it's simpler to maintain. Perhaps the sole purpose of this language is to teach programming 
logic to laypeople or challenge anyone without restrictions to create programs with a 
slightly different logic.

I drew inspiration from the syntax of the BASIC language. I hope you like it.
Feel free to suggest any improvements; I provide the source code for the interpreter.
